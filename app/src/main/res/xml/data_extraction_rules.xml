    Data extraction rules for NanoChat (Android 12+)

    EXCLUDES all SharedPreferences from cloud backup to prevent sensitive data exposure:
    - Session tokens (authentication credentials)
    - User IDs and emails
    - Backend URLs
    - TTS/STT settings
    - Theme preferences

    Even though we use EncryptedSharedPreferences, excluding backups prevents:
    1. Cloud exposure of encrypted data (reduces attack surface)
    2. Token persistence beyond device lifecycle
    3. Potential decryption attacks on backup files

    Note: Local device-to-device transfers (D2D) are also excluded for consistency.
